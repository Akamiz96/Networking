# üìí Exercises to practice Maximum channel capacity üìí
---

> Assume that the spectrum of a channel is located between 3Mhz and 4 MHz and that the SNR is 24 dB.

---

> The telephone channel has a bandwidth of 3 kHz and a signal/noise ratio greater than 30 dB (at least they promise this a lot). The maximum data rate that a modem can produce for this wired channel and expect errors not to become rampant is capacity.

---

> If we assume that a voice channel with a bandwidth of 3100 Hz is used with a modem to transmit digital data (2 levels), what would be the capacity of the channel?
