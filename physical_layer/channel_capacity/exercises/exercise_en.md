# ðŸ“’ Exercises to practice Maximum channel capacity ðŸ“’

> Assume that the spectrum of a channel is located between 3Mhz and 4 MHz and that the SNR is 24 dB.

> The telephone channel has a bandwidth of 3 kHz and a signal/noise ratio greater than 30 dB (at least they promise this a lot). The maximum data rate that a modem can produce for this wired channel and expect errors not to become rampant is capacity.
