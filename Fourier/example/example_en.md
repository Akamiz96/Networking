# Example of application of Fourier's Theorem

It should be clarified that the method applied in this example is a step by step designed for engineers as this is their first approach to Fourier and the mathematics behind it.

This method is designed to find the various harmonic components next to the forward voltage value of a sequence of bits.

Use is made of the equations presented in [✒️ Fourier's Theorem ✒️](Fourier\explanation\explanation_en.md)

For this example, the signal presented below will be used.
