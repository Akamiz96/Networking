# ✒️ Fourier's theorem ✒️ 

The French physicist and mathematician [Jean–Baptiste Joseph Fourier](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier) (1768−1830) formulated a theorem in 1807 stating that:

> Any **periodic signal** *g(t)* defined in time, can be decomposed into a component of **Forward Voltage** *(dc)* and an **infinite number of sine and cosine signals** *(harmonics)*.

That is, a periodic signal can be built with an **infinite sum of sine and cosine signals**.

A sinusoidal signal is represented mathematically by:

$$
\begin{align}
f~1~(t) = a * sin(2\pi f t + \varphi)
\end{align}
$$

where:
- *a* indicates the amplitude of the sine signal
- *f* indicates the frequency of the sine signal
- *t* indicates time
- $\varphi$ indicates the initial phase of the sine signal

Example of a sine signal is below ($y = sin(x)$):

A cosine signal is represented mathematically by:

$$
\begin{align}
f~1~(t) = a * sin(2\pi f t + \varphi)
\end{align}
$$

where:
- *a* indicates the amplitude of the cosine signal
- *f* indicates the frequency of the cosine signal
- *t* indicates time
- $\varphi$ indicates the initial phase of the cosine signal

Example of a cosine signal is below ($y = sin(x)$):
